# PoC-GCP

## Getting start
For test this code you should need to have an GCP account, Cloud SDK and have the three services mentioned on the commit.

###Be care
Once you have all requierments you could have problems with auth to access to the services locally so i recomend to complete proper with the application.properties and also use 
'''
gcloud auth application-default login
'''
